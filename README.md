# Intruder Killer (formerly called DSHbot)
This bot is used to detect intruders listed by CDSH and UDSA for Discord servers.

## So what are CDSH and UDSA?
CDSH = Council of Discord Server Hub, which is in charge of management of a wiki with a server list, a bot list, ban list and a moderator board. Owned by me. DSH is located at http://discord.shoutwiki.com.

UDSA = United Discord Server Alliance, which unites server owners to defend intruders/improve servers. Owned by Volcom Astro.

## Features
* Detects intruders joining your server! (But, this bot only detects when they join.)
  * This bot updates ban list automatically, from my website!
  * In addition of the default ban list, you can customize your blacklist!
* Commands
  * `dshreport`: Show you how to report. Execute this command before banning an undetected intruder!
  * `dshset`: Set up a channel for notifications.

## To-Dos
* `dshset` command.
